# Chefs-Kiss-App

## About the Project 

During the project, our team decided to construct a recipe website where users could create, edit and view their recipes.  We had several ideas and features we wanted to add, such as a rating system with stars and the ability to comment on other users' recipes. 
Still, due to time constraints, we focused on getting a finished product out before features. Our inspiration didn’t derive from any particular place simply because the website would have a straightforward layout.

## How to run 
Upon cloning the project, you will have to run two terminals, one running an express and the other for the React app. My-app is the file for React, and the Chefs-kiss-app base file can run express.
